# Girl Unity web app

Girl Unity is the **first** project I had coded. 


I built the front-end using HTML and CSS and created user databases using PHP. 


This web app was used in partnership with [Children of Peace Uganda](https://childrenofpeaceuganda.wordpress.com/).
We worked with ex-child soldiers in Lira, Uganda to provide them mentorship and teach them how to code.
